"""A lyrical masterpiece, truly a work of literature even a young Shakespeare would be proud of. Lil Pump's teachings of unity have truly touched my heart. When i first heard this masterpiece I was a bit skeptical, but after indulging myself into this song and finding the hidden messages buried underneath the lyrical genius of this mastermind. I can assure you there is much more to this song than Gucci Gang X365... I can only imagine years of slaving away in complete isolation with complete focus to create a song with such depth. Sadly, I do not have the mastermind of Lilliam Pumpernickel but I have been able to decipher some of the lyrics of the song and I have decided to share my analysis. I believe Lilliam song alludes to the ideology of unity and uses the slang term ""gang"" which from the late 90's to early 2000's used to represent criminal organizations but is now used as a term for a group of friends."" The word ""Gucci"" can be interpreted in 2 different ways as a popular clothing brand used as an efficient way for the wealthy to show off their wealth or the literal translation a word that means good, great, fine,awesome and ect. Each of these translations mean the same thing and it's quite obvious. Lilliam see the poverty in this world, he himself has experienced it. This song is a cry for help, he wishes to band together an army of influential people and create a new world order.

"7.09/10 is the real score on rotten tomatoes and the score is based on the average notes of 36 critics (for now). 89% is NOT a score, it represents how many critics who gave a score of 6 or more out of 10 (Fresh, that's why the tomatoe is red). I've watched the movie and I think it deserves a 3 out of 5. Yes the marketing was bad (especially the Netflix poster), but the cinematography is great, the acting, the sound mixing and there are many good scenes. Overall (if we stand aside the politics), I think it's a pretty good film. How many people will continue to judge it without watching it? Remember A Clocwork Orange, which was banned in United Kingdom because some clowns didn't get it? The same phenomenon is being recreated here, judging a piece out of context and without the meaning of the other scenes.",1,1,1,1

"A lot of people think Netflix was stupid to release Cuties when it was obvious that the reception would be negative. A lot of people also think that they have achieved a huge victory with their dislikes and angry comments.
 But the truth is that Netflix knew exactly what they were doing. The goal was not to make people who watch Cuties say ""this is fine"", the goal was to make people more accepting towards media which is beneath Cuties on the Pedophilia scale. An example is Toddlers and Tiaras. Up until now people saw T&T as the extreme of child abuse on TV, but from now on, people will say ""well at least it's not Cuties"".
 And that is exactly why they released Cuties. They didn't want it to make a profit, they didn't want it to be popular, they wanted it to shift the overton window. And in a few years, they will make a movie which makes Cuties look acceptable.
 Rinse and repeat",1,0,1,-

"A lyrical masterpiece, truly a work of literature even a young Shakespear would be proud of. Lil Pump's teachings of unity have truly touched my heart. When i first heard this masterpiece I was a bit skeptical, but after indulging myself into this song and finding the hidden messages buried underneath the lyrical genius of this mastermind. I can assure you there is much more to this song than Gucci Gang x365... I can only imagine years of slaving away in complete isolation with complete focus to create a song with such depth. Sadly, I do not have the mastermind of  Lilliam Pumpernickel but I have been able to decipher some of the lyrics of the song and I have decided to share my analysis. I believe Lilliam song alludes to the ideology of unity and uses the slang term ""gang"" which from the late 90's to early 2000's used to represent criminal organization's but is now used as a term for ""a group of friends."" The word ""Gucci"" can be interpreted in 2 different ways as a popular clothing brand used as an efficient way for the wealthy to show off their wealth or the literal translation a word that means good, great, fine,awesome and ect. Each of these translations mean the same thing and it's quite obvious. Lilliam see the poverty in this world, he himself has experienced it. This song is a cry for help, he wishes to band together an army of influential people and create a new world order. One were your status doesn't determine your lifestyle, but one where there is true equality... Perhaps a Gucci Gang",1,1,1,1

"Absolutely disgusting netflix, you should know better they are children. This movie  crossed all sorts of lines. Im a woman and I felt uncomfortable watching it. I only watched it because I am a fan of Nancy Grace and she referred to it as pornography. That sparked my curiosity but then I realized it was about 11 year old girls. I was tempted to turn it off at many points but I kept telling myself OK ITS NOT THAT BAD... but as the movie played I saw it got worse with each scene. Its funny how when the girls were gyrating and dry humping the fliming focal point was on their asses and breasts. Thats when you got the close up views. Not to mention when she took a pic pf her genitals and shared it on social media!!! Who makes a movie about 11 year olds and the age rating is TV-MA. That means the actors aren't even old enough to watch it!!!!  I'm am still in shock that something like this could make it onto your service.  I am truly considering taking my subscription over to Hulu.",0,0,0,0

"Acabo de ver esta película y mi pregunta es ¿Que cojones os pasa en la cabeza? Es una crítica a la sociedad que tenemos, el mundo del visual está inundado de niñas imitando lo que ven y eso es lo que están viendo hoy en día con los videoclips que se producen (he trabajado en muchos, pasaros por mi canal, si quieren), el mundo del tik tok está repleto de este contenido y hay muchísimos niños y niñas que están en rango de edad no correspondido, como ocurre en esta película. Jamás he sentido atracción, no he visto nada QUE NO me haya sorprendido porque gente... esto lo hace Beyoncé, Jennifer López, Becky G, entre otras miles y los niños copian de sus referentes!! No sé en qué cueva están metidos que se sorprenden porque pase esto en el mundo, pero es así, es la realidad y el final de esta película es maravilloso. Aparte tenéis que entender el contexto de la protagonista que está en una sociedad cohibida, ya preestablecida y abuso del hombre ha hacer con la mujer lo que le dé la real gana, se llama motivo.",2,2,2,-

Aren't they the ""experts"" who've been trained to look for signs of sexual abuse in the home? If an 11 year old girl was ""acting out"" in a school setting in any way like these girls did in the movie, teachers are trained to get involved...most would report it to child protective services so they can investigate if there's any sexual abuse going on in the child's life. Also, we now know of many child actors who suffered sexual abuse while on tv/movie sets and their shows/movies weren't even sexually explicit. So what about these girls in the movie? We need to fight for them, too. Clearly they have been sexually abused and some of this was filmed and shared with the world. It's NOT ok. What Netflix has done is NOT ok.",0,0,0,0

That took some balls to put the lyrics in the description so that everyone can read them and see exactly how horrible he is at writing lyrics. I guess I'm not clear what Ricegums goal was here.

"Before everyone shames the film out of existence, do the world a favor and use it for good, don’t shut down an opportunity to propagate your voice further! What you see is happening in the world regardless if you turn a blind eye.  Also stop asking questions on here as if you’ll get a worthy answer, there’s no answers for you in the comments, you wouldn’t notice an answer if it were right in front of you, your brain is too worried about finding details supporting your already confirmed beliefs.  I encourage everyone to put aside their dissent and employ a sense of openness to whatever light may be shed in the future.   Other than that, no need to parrot everyone’s comments.",1,2,2,-
"Before I start: I want to carry Angelina Jolies baby to term,  9 months, and look in her eyes when I go into labor and never look away until  I deliver. She’s still that fine.   Anyway, Not a marvel or dc fanatic. I just like good movies. Unfortunately, like other modern Disney movies, trying to shove certain modern social ideals down my throat just make the movie cringey in certain parts. The flow is broken.  The acting was unnatural in many parts. Angelina Jolie and the guy who played Gilgamesh were good. Oh and the Bollywood star and his camera man ended up being funny altho, initially I thought their humor was going to be cheesy throughput.  So 👍🏾. I’d say 5.5 out of 10. If you watch it you won’t hate it but if you don’t, you didn’t miss out on a “gem”.",2,2,2,-

The only time we talked was when the bills were due. Then Jacob crafted this song. I played it for her one day and a miracle happened. It was a feeling between us that couldnt be described but as we listened to this song, we looked into each others eyes. We hadn't felt like this in a long while, and made sweet passionate love to Jacob's song. It was life changing and I cannot describe what happened. Dope song 10/10. Would listen again.",1,1,1,1

Maybe entertainment magazine industry need to take a look at themselves of using sex as an entertainment as this can give ideas and inspiration to kids in general. For instance Harley Quinn poster isn’t kinda borderline porn ish especially for lil girls... just saying the world needs to be careful of what they potray to kids cuz kids follow adults. Instead of attacking 1 movie maybe can take a look at the whole industry using sex to sells, in commercial, language, music videos, they all portraying too much sex... closing down netflix n this movie won’t solve the problem... it is the whole society need to be look at. I think it is also cultural thing... in the past in Asia kid’s don’t behave like these, but with Kpop girls its very much sexualize everything... n kids watch these, we have a bigger issue to handle. Remember kids immitate adults we need to be more responsible what we put out there",0,0,0,0

And the fact you thought there was a need to insult H3 and Pewdiepie makes it seem like Rice was insecure that Ian had more memorable and respected friends than he could have the chance to achieve. The entire thing is just underdeveloped on Rice's side, but I agree with him on one thing; Idubbz really didn't need to do as much research as he did to point out how shitty a person Rice can be",0,0,0,0

And that is exactly what this video is. The lyrics and the video cover all of the things that idubbz criticizes ricegum about, and instead of trying to change his character in an explanation (like what many others have done) ricegum said “fuck it im me, I’m happy with me, I have fans that love me that are happy with me and the way I am. I am who I am, idubbz is just hating and he wins if I change, so I’m just going to be who I am because I love myself and others love me for me as well.”. Genius move on ricegum’s part.

"Criticising sexualisation of children by having a movie which sexualises children is DEFINITELY not the right way to criticise the sexualisation of children as it can be considered hypocritical. However, there are people that are LITERALLY cancelling their Netflix subscriptions as a result of the movie Cuties not being taken down. I also see that as hypocrisy as viewers think this movie goes way too far but those same viewers decide to reject THOUSANDS of movies that Netflix has to offer that does not support sexualisation of children in order to show the EXTREME disgust and filth that this movies gives out to society. This could either be because people ASSUME that all Netflix employees are pedophiles or this movie is SO trash that cancelling your ENTIRE Netflix subscription is justifiable. However, when there is an anime that sexualises lolis, anime fans just say that there are other anime’s to watch that does not support this.  These inconsistencies between different forms of entertainment show us just how much easier it is to follow social norms rather than show our true thoughts and opinions on a movie, game, anime, tv show etc. The media loves to blast the few that don’t fit social norms and the majority that are considered ‘normal’ by society are ignored and moved on because they are not worthy enough of the bloodthirsty society that craves on drama and cringe in order to satisfy their LOVE for HATE.  I will clearly state that I am NOT a pedophile but I overall think that the bad apples are exploded out of proportion and the majority of good apples are OFTEN overlooked as it does NOT satisfy the online community’s thirst for drama. I also think that bad apples that are liked by the majority have a VERY DEFENSIVE community that will attack anyone with a negative opinion and bad apples that are hated by the majority such as Cuties are VERY AGGRESSIVE towards anyone that does not show enough hatred or any positivity towards movies such as Cuties as they may possibly be pedophiles.  Nobody probably cares about my comment but I just wanted to get my thoughts off my chest about the whole situation.",1,0,1,-

"Cuties is actually an amazing film. Those comparing it to pornography need to do some research on what child pornography is, and the truly horrendous conditions those babies are in.  This was a whole movie with choreographers, lawyers, contracts and parents on set..  Those offended by the movement of the girls truly missed the point, the message and an opportunity to have a really important conversation with our young girls.  If you paid attention, the movie pointed to the influence that a heavily sexualized culture (in which women are objectified and encouraged to use their bodies as currency) has on our babies.  It was an expose an exploration and a warning.  Yall do what you want tho... i aint boycotting nothing but trump.",1,1,1,1

"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis “the wise”? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It’s ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",0,0,0,0

"Don't you love when people get outraged by something, and they'll get LIVID over the bit of media they see, but they don't do anything about it except dislike a video and complain to their friends and family... Watch the people who read this first line and get pissed without even reading the rest...     Alright, haters are gonna hate however this goes, I'm willing to bet most the people talkin crap about 'Cuties' in this comment section haven't been out of their own state, let alone to another Country. Buddy, you think this is bad, you ought to see the 8 year old girls that are pregnant with 30 year old boyfriends in Brazil. You think that's messed up? how about the 11 year old strippers from Burma who pay for their smoking and drinking addictions with their ""work"" money? What about the 13 year old Swedish girls who when you ask them why they're smoking on a street corner at 11PM, and they respond with ""oh I only smoke after sex with my boyfriend""? How about the fact that everything that people are saying are horrible about this trailer already exists in the world we live in, and they were totally fine with it existing (because if you really weren't okay wth it, you'd be doing more than just saying ""it's not okay"" and then going about your life with no future plans of action to change said issue) , but the moment it hits a TV show, it's all the rage to ""BAN NETFLIX"". Like, look bud, yeah, get it out of your face for sure, cause it's nice not to have to see it, but maybe there is an underlying problem here, like...   the fact that it exists in the first place.   Glad you are all gung-ho to ban netflix and get this sleezy garbage off of the content you watch, because, rightfully so, it does not belong in our media... but if this current motivation doesn't lead to more than just a ""give me ignorance or I'll complain loudly"" result, then more stuff like this is just going to continue. Yes I recognize that writing it here isn't going to do anything significant for anyone reading this, because likely none of you can currently do anything about this issue besides dislike this video, complain about it to your friends, talk about how bad the world is, and go back to doing what you were doing yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that. If you can do someting, and you haven't/aren't doing it, shame on you.    You wanna prove that you actually want to stop this from happening ever again? Get behind a leader who's gonna change the world. If you can't be there personally, find a way to support those who are doing something, either financially or through the spreading of awareness that THERE IS MORE TO THE ISSUE AND A WAY TO FIGHT IT. Don't believe that I, among others who possess the drive and willingess to be different, can really change the world? Those who question whether or not it can be done should get out of the way of those who are in the process of doing it.   It's the time to develop leaders who are going to change the world. If you see this and you want to actually do something about this, don't just speak up about it; Find the way to remind yourself of it daily, make the connections needed to those who are doing something about it, and remember: see the NEED and FILL IT. Realize that it will take time, and likely a lot of patience to get around those whose association will help you toward your goals.   Feel free to show your support, also feel free to show your hate. The haters are just motivation, and the support becomes affiliation, until this problem faces its eradication.  Honestly, I'm just using this comment section as a place holder for this comment, so, come the day that I finally carve out the path to fight this garbage at the source rather than waiting for it to hit our TV shows, I can say: ""That was the start of the journey, and finally we're getting some results"". I don't care who I partner with, or however many sleepless nights it takes to find the right path. This will be fought, and destroyed, at the source of the issue. Not just at the, ""netflix"", level.",1,2,1,-

"Doucouré, surprised by the wave of criticism that she and her film received, declared to a portal, “I only hope that these people see the film, because then they will realize that we are actually on the same side of this battle against the hypersexualization of children ”.  The film even received criticism from people who had not seen it, people who prefer to close their eyes to situations that are far from being fiction. Some scenes could make many uncomfortable, but we must not lose sight of the fact that the film is told from the eyes of Amy, whose motivation is to be accepted in a world where being a woman means fulfilling a social role. It is true that at times the camera rests on the bodies of girls exposing them, but it does so to critically represent how the mass media and social networks spread a message on a daily basis where the objectification of women generally results in success.",1,1,1,1

"E finalmente assisti ao polêmico filme francês ""Lindinhas"" (título em português), que arrebatou prêmios importantes no Festival de Sundance e Berlim neste ano de 2020 . Alardes sobre a suposta sexualização infantil ao colocar adolescentes com roupas apertadas e curtas, ""Lindinhas"" utiliza desse chamariz inusitado e original em sua narrativa para defender seu argumento bastante triste: de como a Educação contemporânea baseada em dogmas religiosos e conservadores acabam levando adolescentes ao mundo ""fútil da globalização"", na qual roupas transadas e danças sensuais são pré requisitos para os adolescentes conseguirem ""amigos"" ( fúteis) e namoradinhos... Muita Repressão na Educação leva ao desejo de libertinagem : esse é o mote principal de ""Lindinhas""! Então, deve - se liberar tudo para os adolescentes, desde sexo e drogas desenfreados? Não! E isso é exemplificado no final do filme ""Lindinhas"" : a protagonista, uma adolescente afrodescendente, foge de seu concurso de dança para o ""segundo casamento de seu pai"" ( a religião da mesma permite que o homem possa casar com várias mulheres) e chegando lá, sua mãe a repreende e até elogia a filha, dizendo "" Você não é obrigada a ir na festa""... Mãe com inveja da liberdade da filha? Hum... Não sei... Mais a protagonista do filme ""Lindinhas"" , vesti uma calça comprida e uma camisa nada obscena e desce de seu apartamento e, vai pular corda com os vizinhos, como uma típica pré adolescente... ""Quebrar a cara"" ou frustrações faz parte do amadurecimento de qualquer Indivíduo, seja adolescente ou adulto... E que bom que no final do filme, a protagonista do filme compreendeu isso, e vestiu - se com a vaidade típica de uma adolescente, mais sem vulgaridades e... Foi pular corda! No mais, um filme Excelente, recomendo ""Lindinhas"".",1,1,1,1

"En dépeignant une image aussi non désinfectée, elle tient pour responsables ceux qui ont normalisé et sanctionné l'hypersexualisation des enfants en consommant ces mêmes contenus sous le couvert d'un divertissement inoffensif. Si Amy voit les visages derrière les «vues» au concours de danse, les spectateurs aussi regardent le seul point de réalité dans le monde virtuel: les enfants. La répugnance inscrite sur leurs visages est qu'ils se révoltent pour ce qu'ils ont eux-mêmes nourri. Privés du confort de leur téléphone, ils reculent. D'une certaine manière, la récente polémique de l'annulation de Cuties au motif même que le film tente de faire - sexualisation prématurée des enfants - corrobore cette lecture. Cette fois, le public est plus large, ainsi que l'écran, mais le sentiment de désarroi est partagé. Cela ressemble presque à ce qu'Amy aurait pu ressentir pendant la bagarre - un inconfort viscéral en étant vue.",0,0,0,0

"Esse filme é problemático em tantos níveis e chega a ser a mais problemático ainda o fato das pessoas forçarem um crítica que não existe. O filme em nenhum momento critica a sexualização infantil , ele poderia ter abordado como a mídia influência isso , como é tratado com naturalidade muitas vezes  e etc... Porém o filme tem um enredo extremamente pobre , consegue demonizar a religião e os costumes  da protagonista ,  inúmeras cenas com sexualização desnecessária ALERTA DE SPOILER (  a cena onde a amy ensina a coreografia para as garotas existe claramente uma exposição das atrizes q não há argumentos que justifique . A bunda das garotas ficam sendo focadas por minutos e minutos seguidos de maneira desnecessária  e fora a cena do "" exorcismo "" onde a amy com um corpo molhado faz posições sexuais , enquanto ao fundo deixam uma respiração ofegante simulando um ato sexual . O filme é repleto de cenas desnecessárias onde nenhuma delas apresentam um tipo de crítica . TER SENSO CRÍTICO NÃO É VER CRÍTICA EM TUDO!!!!!",2,2,2,-

Eternal is fantastic movie our expect.. it's like thor who first not good but after it's a brand... That's why the upcoming films of eternal is such a good movie... I love this movie,1,1,1,1
"Eternals is a movie that tries to break out of the narrative conventions of previous MCU films, and in that it gets large props. However, it posits the question of ""is humanity really worth saving"" by offering the Disney-esque answer of: shrug sure. It's still a very enjoyable film that occasionally has brings up some great topics, including the objectivist notions we have of superheroes, while delivering on it's action, which while not Avengers-level epic, are still spectacular.",1,1,1,1
Eternals is interesting but could've been absolutely stellar as a TV show. The potential for storytelling across human history and finishing it with a movie that serves as a series finale. What could've been...,2,2,2,-
Eternals is not that bad as the critics suggests. It's a pretty good depiction of Marvel's cosmic universe. It's like an origin story of the MCU itself. Liked the way they Integrated the story to human civilizations.,1,1,1,1
"Eternals is the 2nd movie that explain about Celestials, the first is Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2",1,1,1,1

"Eternals made me realise why thanos did what he did. Thanos was trying to delay the emergents, it kind of makes me pity him.",1,1,1,1
"Eternals should be the mysterious hero, who save human from deviants only. Not interfere in any human conflicts. The Trailer more goosebump rather than the movie.",2,2,2,-
"Eternals story has very similarities with the game Star Control 2 The Celestial emerging from worlds is like the Deep Child of Mycons The sentient life being harvested by Celestials is done by Ethernal Ones in SC2. To harvest sentience in great quantity, the Eternal Ones planted ""seeds"" throughout the universe that created all the other races in the Star Control. I don't know which one is written earlier but these two are very similar, just like `Lucas Art's Monkey Island Series` and `Pirates of The Caribbeans` franchise.",1,1,1,1
Eternals trending #1 on Disney+,1,1,1,1
Eternals was for sure a different take for marvel but it was definitely a movie to set up future mcu projects.,1,1,1,1
"Eternals was really good. It’s really different, albeit a little lengthy. I almost felt like it may have been better as a Dis+ series just because it covers soooooooo much time and so much character development. But it’s definitely an awesome experience and I do wanna see it again.",1,1,1,1

"First off I want to say I actually Loved the movie... May not be the best hero movie which WE all can agree but unlike most people I actually Truly Enjoyed the Movie! When I went to the movies to go see it I didn't quit get it. But thanks to Disney+ and watching it at least 5 or 6times now since released I have a Better Understanding of it. Had to go back and watch Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 because I though of Peter Quill's father and of course I watched Avengers Infinity War again Thanks ONCE AGAIN TO Disney+ but It really makes me thank of Thano's Differently now as When he said the Universe required correction. Sacrificing Billions to save Trillions.... I get why he did it now, Snapping away half of the people on Earth also Delayed the Celestial from waking up because as Arishem said Life is what brings the Celestial to life.  Not saying Thano's knew about them but it makes you think he SOMEWHAT KNEW About Something close, so Snapping everyone away worked but as you know when the Avengers Brought Everyone back it resumed the Process on Earth. But yes unlike MOST I actually enjoyed it",1,1,1,1
